;;; josh-core-keybinds.el --- Josh's Emacs Config: Global keybinds

;; Author: Josh Porter <josh@joshporter.xyz>
;; URL: https://github.com/joshporterdev/.emacs.d

;;; Commentary:

;; Set up the general key definer which will serve as the base for all additional keybinds.
;; Also add which-key for better documented keybinds.

;;; Code:

(use-package which-key
  :init
    (which-key-mode 1)
  :config
  (setq which-key-side-window-location 'bottom
	  which-key-sort-order #'which-key-key-order-alpha
	  which-key-sort-uppercase-first nil
	  which-key-add-column-padding 1
	  which-key-max-display-columns nil
	  which-key-min-display-lines 6
	  which-key-side-window-slot -10
	  which-key-side-window-max-height 0.25
	  which-key-idle-delay 0.8
	  which-key-max-description-length 25
	  which-key-allow-imprecise-window-fit t
